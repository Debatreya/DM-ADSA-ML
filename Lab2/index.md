### Problem Statement
>Download any two datasets of your choice comprising different 
types of attributes. Compute and analyze central tendency (mean, median 
and mode), dispersion (range, quartiles, interquartile range, variance and 
standard deviation) of different attributes and covariance and correlation 
matrix for the given datasets. Discuss your observations regarding which 
operation is logically apt for given attribute type and regarding 
characteristics of datasets which can be observed based on covariance and 
correlation matrix.
>>The objective is to understand the central tendencies and dispersion of the data attributes.

### Data Set
- **WINE**: [Wine Dataset](../wine/wine.data)

### Code and Output
- **[WINE Notebook](./wine-index.ipynb)**
- **[IRIS Notebook](./iris-index.ipynb)**

### Observations
No such observations (The objective is to understand the central tendencies and dispersions of the data attributes.)
