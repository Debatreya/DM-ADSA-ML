Loading the Data:

The dataset is loaded using pd.read_csv.
We print the first few rows and the data types to understand the structure.
Data Splitting:

We separate the features (X) and labels (y), and split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn.
Euclidean Distance:

We define the euclidean_distance function to compute the distance between two points.
k-NN Algorithm:

The knn_predict function calculates the distance from the test point to all training points, sorts them, and selects the k nearest neighbors.
The most common label among the neighbors is chosen as the prediction.
Prediction and Evaluation:

We loop over the test set, making predictions for each data point, and store correct and incorrect predictions.
Finally, we print both correct and incorrect predictions.
